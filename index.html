        <h3> This week in physicalVirology: HIV </h3>
            <p> HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus. Retrovirus means HIV converts its genomic RNA into DNA to create progeny viruses. It is also a lentivirus.
                Lentivirus means HIV can enter the nucleus of nondiving target cells into Human body. HIV uses various host cell proteins and small molecules to invade cells of human body. As a counter mechanism human body uses different mechanisms to protect it from HIV. So there is a tug of war between the two. HIV comes with a protective shell known as capsid which provides a protection of its RNA from human defense mechansim. 
                In the end when the human defense mechanism fails HIV takes over and causes AIDS in human body which may ultimately become fatal. Currently, there is no cure to HIV but there treaments to control the disease progression. 
                 Among the treatments, a new drug, Sunlenca approved by FDA significantly improved patient control over the disease and apeared to be a game-changer to counter the virus.
